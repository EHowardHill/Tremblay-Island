<p>Other Unix-like platforms, such as OpenBSD, are known to work as well, but are untested and not fully supported.</p>

<h3>System requirements</h3>

<p>Requirements are minimal. Any computer that can run Windows Vista or newer should be able to handle emulation. Support for OpenGL 1.1 or newer is also required, with OpenGL 3.2 or newer for shaders and advanced features.</p>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>Downloads can be found on the official website, in the <a href="http://mgba.io/downloads.html">Downloads</a> section. The source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<p>Controls are configurable in the settings menu. Many game controllers should be automatically mapped by default. The default keyboard controls are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong>: X</li>
<li><strong>B</strong>: Z</li>
<li><strong>L</strong>: A</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>: S</li>
<li><strong>Start</strong>: Enter</li>
<li><strong>Select</strong>: Backspace</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>Compiling requires using CMake 3.1 or newer. GCC and Clang are both known to work to compile mGBA, but Visual Studio 2013 and older are known not to work. Support for Visual Studio 2015 and newer is coming soon.</p>

<h4>Docker building</h4>

<p>The recommended way to build for most platforms is to use Docker. Several Docker images are provided that contain the requisite toolchain and dependencies for building mGBA across several platforms.</p>

<p>To use a Docker image to build mGBA, simply run the following command while in the root of an mGBA checkout:</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm -t -v $PWD:/home/mgba/src mgba/windows:w32
</code></pre>

<p>This will produce a <code>build-win32</code> directory with the build products. Replace <code>mgba/windows:w32</code> with another Docker image for other platforms, which will produce a corresponding other directory. The following Docker images available on Docker Hub:</p>

<ul>
<li>mgba/3ds</li>
<li>mgba/switch</li>
<li>mgba/ubuntu:xenial</li>
<li>mgba/ubuntu:bionic</li>
<li>mgba/ubuntu:focal</li>
<li>mgba/ubuntu:groovy</li>
<li>mgba/vita</li>
<li>mgba/wii</li>
<li>mgba/windows:w32</li>
<li>mgba/windows:w64</li>
</ul>

<h4>*nix building</h4>

<p>To use CMake to build on a Unix-based system, the recommended commands are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr ..
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>This will build and install mGBA into <code>/usr/bin</code> and <code>/usr/lib</code>. Dependencies that are installed will be automatically detected, and features that are disabled if the dependencies are not found will be shown after running the <code>cmake</code> command after warnings about being unable to find them.</p>

<p>If you are on macOS, the steps are a little different. Assuming you are using the homebrew package manager, the recommended commands to obtain the dependencies and build are:</p>

<pre><code>brew install cmake ffmpeg libzip qt5 sdl2 libedit pkg-config
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=`brew --prefix qt5` ..
make
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you should not do a <code>make install</code> on macOS, as it will not work properly.</p>

<h4>Windows developer building</h4>

<h5>MSYS2</h5>

<p>To build on Windows for development, using MSYS2 is recommended. Follow the installation steps found on their <a href="https://msys2.github.io">website</a>. Make sure you're running the 32-bit version ("MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit") (or the 64-bit version "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" if you want to build for x86_64) and run this additional command (including the braces) to install the needed dependencies (please note that this involves downloading over 1100MiB of packages, so it will take a long time):</p>

<pre><code>pacman -Sy --needed base-devel git ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-{cmake,ffmpeg,gcc,gdb,libelf,libepoxy,libzip,pkgconf,qt5,SDL2,ntldd-git}
</code></pre>

<p>Check out the source code by running this command:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba.git
</code></pre>

<p>Then finally build it by running these commands:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p mgba/build
cd mgba/build
cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles"
make -j$(nproc --ignore=1)
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that this build of mGBA for Windows is not suitable for distribution, due to the scattering of DLLs it needs to run, but is perfect for development. However, if distributing such a build is desired (e.g. for testing on machines that don't have the MSYS2 environment installed), running <code>cpack -G ZIP</code> will prepare a zip file with all of the necessary DLLs.</p>

<h5>Visual Studio</h5>

<p>To build using Visual Studio is a similarly complicated setup. To begin you will need to install <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg">vcpkg</a>. After installing vcpkg you will need to install several additional packages:</p>

<pre><code>vcpkg install ffmpeg[vpx,x264] libepoxy libpng libzip sdl2 sqlite3
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this installation won't support hardware accelerated video encoding on Nvidia hardware. If you care about this, you'll need to install CUDA beforehand, and then substitute <code>ffmpeg[vpx,x264,nvcodec]</code> into the previous command.</p>

<p>You will also need to install Qt. Unfortunately due to Qt being owned and run by an ailing company as opposed to a reasonable organization there is no longer an offline open source edition installer for the latest version, so you'll need to either fall back to an <a href="https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.12/5.12.9/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.12.9.exe">old version installer</a> (which wants you to create an otherwise-useless account, but you can bypass temporarily setting an invalid proxy or otherwise disabling networking), use the online installer (which requires an account regardless), or use vcpkg to build it (slowly). None of these are great options. For the installer you'll want to install the applicable MSVC versions. Note that the offline installers do not support MSVC 2019. For vcpkg you'll want to install it as such, which will take quite a while, especially on quad core or less computers:</p>

<pre><code>vcpkg install qt5-base qt5-multimedia
</code></pre>

<p>Next, open Visual Studio, select Clone Repository, and enter <code>https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba.git</code>. When Visual Studio is done cloning, go to File > CMake and open the CMakeLists.txt file at the root of the checked out repository. From there, mGBA can be developed in Visual Studio similarly to other Visual Studio CMake projects.</p>

<h4>Toolchain building</h4>

<p>If you have devkitARM (for 3DS), devkitPPC (for Wii), devkitA64 (for Switch), or vitasdk (for PS Vita), you can use the following commands for building:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../src/platform/3ds/CMakeToolchain.txt ..
make
</code></pre>

<p>Replace the <code>-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</code> parameter for the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>3DS: <code>../src/platform/3ds/CMakeToolchain.txt</code></li>
<li>Switch: <code>../src/platform/switch/CMakeToolchain.txt</code></li>
<li>Vita: <code>../src/platform/psp2/CMakeToolchain.vitasdk</code></li>
<li>Wii: <code>../src/platform/wii/CMakeToolchain.txt</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>mGBA has no hard dependencies, however, the following optional dependencies are required for specific features. The features will be disabled if the dependencies can't be found.</p>

<ul>
<li>Qt 5: for the GUI frontend. Qt Multimedia or SDL are required for audio.</li>
<li>SDL: for a more basic frontend and gamepad support in the Qt frontend. SDL 2 is recommended, but 1.2 is supported.</li>
<li>zlib and libpng: for screenshot support and savestate-in-PNG support.</li>
<li>libedit: for command-line debugger support.</li>
<li>ffmpeg or libav: for video, GIF, WebP, and APNG recording.</li>
<li>libzip or zlib: for loading ROMs stored in zip files.</li>
<li>SQLite3: for game databases.</li>
<li>libelf: for ELF loading.</li>
</ul>

<p>SQLite3, libpng, and zlib are included with the emulator, so they do not need to be externally compiled first.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p><a name="missing">[1]</a> Currently missing features are</p>

<ul>
<li>OBJ window for modes 3, 4 and 5 (<a href="http://mgba.io/b/5">Bug #5</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="flashdetect">[2]</a> Flash memory size detection does not work in some cases. These can be configured at runtime, but filing a bug is recommended if such a case is encountered.</p>

<p><a name="osxver">[3]</a> 10.8 is only needed for the Qt port. It may be possible to build or running the Qt port on 10.7 or older, but this is not officially supported. The SDL port is known to work on 10.5, and may work on older.</p>
