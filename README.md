The first game by Cinemint games! A sequel to **Vous Voil√†**, a novel by yours truly that you can learn a little more about [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QCQ8DNV/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_A6BZSE5MJ3HET2N6PV8P) .

## About the Game

Tremblay Island is a currently in-development GameBoy Advance title built using C++ and the Butano library. You can learn a little more about Butano [here](https://github.com/GValiente/butano) if you're curious.

**I AM ONLY AT THE PROOF OF CONCEPT STAGE!** I've had to build the engine from scratch, and I've never worked with C++ in any serious capacity before this project. However, you should be able to get about 15 minutes of gameplay out of it!

## How to Play

Make sure to download `Demo Build 01.gba`! Then, you'll want to install an emulator of your choice, or flash the ROM to a real GameBoy Advance cartridge. My favorite emulator is mGBA, which can be found [here](https://mgba.io/downloads.html).
