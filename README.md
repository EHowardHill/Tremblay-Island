## About the Game

*Welcome to island life!*

Maple Trmeblay is just about done with her older brother Aaron and his wife Enoki; while Maple's life is grounded and somewhat planned, albeit miserable, Aaron and Enoki constantly go out on a limb to make the most of their lives.

Frustrated, Maple tries to convince the two to settle down, only for her plans to backfire when she inadvertently gives them the idea to start their own sovereign nation on a tiny island.

Tremblay Island is a currently in-development Gameboy Advance title built using C++ and the Butano library. You can learn a little more about Butano [here](https://github.com/GValiente/butano) if you're curious.

The first title by Cinemint Games! A sequel to **Vous Voil√†**, a novel by yours truly that you can learn a little more about [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QCQ8DNV/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_A6BZSE5MJ3HET2N6PV8P) .

A blurb about the story and setting can be found over on my [website](http://www.tremblayisland.com/). I've also got a minute-long [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZlnB7BZ6iQ) if that's more your speed.

**I've only got about 2 hours of gameplay done so far!** I've had to build the engine from scratch, and I've never worked with C++ in any serious capacity before this project. However, I'm learning fast and having a lot of fun.

## How to Play/Build

Make sure to download one of the .GBA files! Then, you'll want to install an emulator of your choice, or flash the ROM to a real GameBoy Advance cartridge. My favorite emulator is mGBA, which can be found [here](https://mgba.io/downloads.html).

You'll want to build from within `games\TremblayIsland`. Instructions on building Butano-based GBA projects can be found over at the link right [here](https://gvaliente.github.io/butano/getting_started.html#getting_started_template). I usually build on WSL 2.0, and I develop within Windows 11.
