The first game by Cinemint games! A sequel to **Vous Voil√†**, a novel by yours truly that you can learn a little more about [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QCQ8DNV/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_A6BZSE5MJ3HET2N6PV8P) .

## Download Links

Make sure to download one of the .GBA files! Then, you'll want to install an emulator of your choice, or flash the ROM to a real GameBoy Advance cartridge. My favorite emulator is mGBA, which can be found [here](https://mgba.io/downloads.html).

More releases will come with the following months!

## How to Build

You'll want to build from within `games\vv2k`. Instructions on building Butano-based GBA projects can be found over at the link right [here](https://gvaliente.github.io/butano/getting_started.html#getting_started_template). I usually build on WSL 2.0, and I develop within Windows 11.

## About the Game

Tremblay Island is a currently in-development GameBoy Advance title built using C++ and the Butano library. You can learn a little more about Butano [here](https://github.com/GValiente/butano) if you're curious.

A blurb about the story and setting can be found over on my [website](http://www.tremblayisland.com/). I've also got a minute-long [trailer](https://youtu.be/Rcy9nHeIZuc) if that's more your speed.

**I've only got about 30 minutes of gameplay done so far!** I've had to build the engine from scratch, and I've never worked with C++ in any serious capacity before this project. However, I'm learning fast and having a lot of fun.
